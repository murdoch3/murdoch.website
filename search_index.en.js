engineering, I like to use Mandiant's FlareVM because it provides all of tools that I need out of the box.\nThe only problem with Flare is that the installation process is manual and time-consuming. It requires users to:\n\nCreate a Windows 10 virtual machine\nComplete the Windows 10 installation process\nFollow a process to disable Windows Defender in the settings and group policy editor\nDownload, unblock, and execute the Flare install PowerShell script\nBabysit Flare during its installation (make choices when prompted, login after reboots, etc.)\n\nI myself have gone through this process more than a dozen times in the recent years, a result of moving between systems. This results in wasted time that could have been spent on analysis and research.\nVagrantfile\nTo solve this problem, I have spent the past few days creating a Vagrantfile to automate the provisioning and installation of FlareVM on HyperV. I have managed to make the installation completely hands-off. The complete code can be seen below:\n\nUsage:\nRequirements: Vagrant, HyperV, and sufficient disk space for the gusztavvargadr/windows-10 Vagrant box and the FlareVM installation.\nGet the latest version of the Vagrant file from here.\nTo use this Vagrantfile to create a FlareVM virtual machine, run the following commands:\n\nThe first command will provision the virtual machine on HyperV, set the autologon credentials and permanently delete Windows Defender. The second will set the AutoAdminLogon registry key and triggers a restart (this sometimes shows errors, but it is the only way I could get auto login to work). The third will install FlareVM.\nHow It Works\nThe Vagrantfile automates the process of provisioning and deploying FlareVM by performing the following tasks:\n\n\nVirtual Machine Provisioning: To provision the VM, I specified that we want to pull the gusztavvargadr/windows-10 Vagrant box and configured our VM settings, including the VM's hostname, provider (i.e., VirtualBox, HyperV, etc.), hardware requirements, and networking configuration.\n\n\n\nDisabling Windows Defender: After trying all of Flare's linked resources without success, I discovered this repo. This is the only automated way I've found to remove Windows Defender from this version of Windows 10. The vagrant provision step downloads the repo and runs Script\\_Run.bat y. This will delete Windows Defender by applying a series of registry changes and then deleting Defender related files from C:\\Windows\\WinSxS, C:\\Windows\\System32, C:\\Windows\\Program Files (x86)\\, etc.\n\n\n\nEnabling Autologon: Enabling Autologon is necessary to prevent the user from having to manually login during the Flare installation. The only way I could get this to work with Vagrant was to perform it in two steps, the first downloading and executing the SysInternals Autologon tool to set the autologon credentials, and the second to set the AutoAdminLogon registry key and reboot (unfortunately, uncleanly).\n\n\n\nFlareVM Installation: The last step is to download and execute the Flare install script. It uses a custom version of the script with a few of the initial prompts commented out. The flags -customConfig, -password, -noWait, and -noGui are used to make the rest of the process automated.\n\n\n\nProblems Faced\nVagrant/Virtualbox: The DHCP on this adapter is incompatible with the DHCP settings\nInitially when I was using Vagrant and Virtualbox, I ran into this error. It was fixed by changing the initial network line:\n\nTo include the Virtualbox's Host-Only network's DHCP information:\n\nVagrant Stuck on Preparing SMB Shared Folders\nThis was solved by just disabling the default vagrant shared folder:\n\nSet-ExecutionPolicy: The Setting is Overridden by a Policy Defined at a More Specific Scope\nI believe this problem has to do with the default ExecutionPolicy of the vagrant box, which can be seen with Get-ExecutionPolicy -List. While it's not elegant, I found setting the execution policies as follows to work consistently:\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, using this Vagrantfile significantly streamlines the creation of a FlareVM virtual machine by fully automating the process.\nAs always, there is room for improvement. Further work could include:\n\nPerforming the Vagrant installation in a single command.\nMaking the Windows Defender Remover script and autologon provisioning Vagrant-compatible by performing the restart with Vagrant reload.\nCreating equivalent VMWare and VirtualBox Vagrantfiles.\nCreating and using a custom Flare ISO or Vagrant box.\n\n","id":"https://murdoch.website/automating-flarevm/","title":"Automate FlareVM with Vagrant"},"https://murdoch.website/decompiling-godot-encrypted/":{"body":"Disclaimer: This guide is intended for educational use only.\nDecryption\nProblem\nWhen we try to recover an encrypted Godot project with Godot RE Tools (link), we get the following error:\n\nHowever, in this version of Godot, the key is stored unobfuscated within the game executable.  This post will show the process of finding this key in an project I exported myself (as discussed in the appendix).\nFinding the Key\nAnalyzing Godot's Source Code\nSince Godot is open-source, we can start our search by grep'ing over the source code for places where encryption, decryption, or keys are mentioned.  Searching for encryption, an interesting reference to script_encryption_key is found:\n\nThe reference is found in gdscript.cpp's GDScript::load_byte_code method, which we know is used for the decryption process at runtime based on this documentation page:\n\nViewing this block of code in VS Code, we can see that the key is read into a uint8 Vector and is used to decrypt a file with AES256 ECB.  This step is performed for file paths ending in \"gde\".  As \"gd\" is the standard file extension for Godot scripts, it seems likely this function is being used to decrypt each of the game's encrypted scripts.\n\nAt this point, we want to see if we can find this function in a disassembler.  Luckily, Godot prints many useful error messages that we can use to perform string searches.  For example, we can peek at the macro expansion for the ERR_FAIL_COND_V macro seen above:\n\nFinding the Decryption Routine in IDA\nUsing IDA, we can use the Strings subview and filter for a string matching the ERROR string we found from the expanded macro above:\n\nWe can now go to the address of the top result, the only string to match ours exactly.  Viewing the xrefs will take us to the function where it is used, which IDA has named sub_1400DAE00 for my example binary.\nFinding the Key\nHaving found the load_byte_code function, we can begin to look for the script_execution_key.  We know from the source code that it is copied over, one byte at a time, to a new vector, and that this is the only loop construct in the function.\nShortly after the condition string is referenced, we find such a loop construct in the IDA decompilation:\n\nWithout having to tease out much, we can tell that the static variable byte_1421E11B8 is likely what we're looking for.  This is because it is a static variable being read, one byte each iteration, into another buffer, just like in the source code.  Furthermore, we can see v87, the buffer the bytes are written into, appears to be initialized to size 32 before the loop via sub_140013410.\nWhen we access byte_1421E11B8, we find our 32-byte key:\n\nThis is the 32-byte key that I generated in the first step of the Appendix.  This key can then be used in Godot RE Tools to decrypt the Godot project's scripts.\nAppendix: Building an Encrypted Godot 3.5.1 Project\nDocumentation: Here\nI'm just using the Godot Third-Person Shooter Demo to test.\nFirst we need to generate a key to use for encryption:\n\nTo be able to use encryption, we need to build our own export templates, using an environment variable to specify our encryption key.

However, I immediately ran into the problem of how you even get it to display on a modern television or monitor.  There were cheap HDMI cables which were universally poorly reviewed.  Then there were specialty devices – Xbox2HDMI, OSSC boxes, or XboxHDMI boards (which you had to install) – which were all significantly more expensive, not even including the flat rate US shipping.  The only middle option appeared to be the Hyperkin Panorama HDMI cable.  It was apparently “Officially Licensed by Xbox”, fairly priced, distributed by Amazon, and fairly well reviewed.  The only problem was that still many users reported graphical problems.  I decided to try it anyway – at least those problems seemed to be fixable.\nSure enough, the cable was unusable out of the box – it had issues with persistent purple waviness and frequent cutting out.  However, these problems are not actually with the cable, but with the source of power coming from the Xbox – likely due to aging capacitors.  There are two solutions I was able to find documented online.  You could either replace the faulty capacitors in the Xbox, or you could provide an external power source to the Panorama cable.  The former was going to require a lot more effort: at the very least you would have to replace the Xbox power supply’s electrolytic capacitors, but you may have to replace some on the motherboard itself (see here and here).  At that point, you might as well plan to completely replace the capacitors, meaning a not insignificant further financial and time investment into the console.\nProviding an external power source to the Panorama cable however is significantly simpler.  It only requires a 5V USB cable and some basic soldering.  This was the obvious place to start with, and it ended up solving all of the graphical issues I had with the console – the purple waviness and the cutting out.\nThe rest of this post will document the process I performed, step-by-step, to fix the cable.  It is based on this Amazon review by Mike Tunstall, to whom I give ultimate credit for finding and documenting this method.\nWhat You Need\n\nA 5V USB charging cable\nSoldering equipment\n\nSoldering iron (I used a Pinecil)\nSolder wire\nFlux\nIsopropyl alcohol\nCopper wick (in case of mistakes)\nOptional: Helping hands (will make the process significantly less finicky)\n\n\nWire cutters\nWire stripper\nPhillips head screwdriver\n\nGuide\nStep 1\nWe’ll start by disassembling the cable’s box, which is as simple as unscrewing the four Phillips head screws on the bottom of the box.\n\nStep 2\nFlipping the board over, we find the GND and 5V pins, which we will solder the appropriate wires from the USB cable to.  This will allow us to remotely power the board over USB rather than via the Xbox.\n\nStep 3\nReferring to the image in Step 2, identify the cable on the flip side of the board connected to the red highlighted 5V pin.  In my case this is the purple cable.  Use your wire cutters to cut it - we no longer want power coming from the Xbox.  (Please note that the brown cable to GND should not be cut.)\nStep 4\nNow we’ll prepare the USB cable.  Cut off one head of the cable, leaving the USB end​​ that will be used to provide power to the cable.  In my case, I used wire cutters to remove the micro-USB head.\nStep 5\nStrip the outer jacket and shield from a length of the USB cable.  I removed about two inches.  At this point, you should just have the four internal USB wires exposed.\nStep 6\nStrip back the insulation of black (GND) and red (5V) wires.  The other two are for data and can be cut back – we do not need them.\n\nStep 7\nIt’s time to solder these wires to their appropriate pins.  You can refer to Step 3 for the colours – black goes to GND, red goes to 5V.  As with any soldering: first clean the points with isopropyl alcohol, then flux and tin the pins and wires, and then solder them in.  (My soldering is admittedly not that great on these points, but they hold and it works perfectly.)  Finally, clean the board with isopropyl alcohol.\n\nStep 8\nNow you can test.  Once the USB, HDMI, and Xbox cables are plugged in, the green LED should come on, indicating the board has power.  When you turn the Xbox on, the graphics distortions should be gone.\nStep 9\nIf all is working, reassemble the box.  To accommodate the new cable, you can create a hole in the side of it.  Alternatively, you could just electrical tape it all together, which is what I did.\nReferences\n\nHyperkin Panorama HDMI cable’s official product page\nMike Tunstall’s Amazon review\nRelevant Reddit post discussing issues with the cable\n\n","id":"https://murdoch.website/fixing-xbox-hdmi/","title":"Fixing Hyperkin's OG Xbox HDMI Cable"},"https://murdoch.website/htb-methodology/":{"body":"Introduction\nThis is a collection of notes, commands, and bullet points to reference when I am working through HackTheBox or other Boot2Root machines.

I would listen to Defcon talks (like this or this), read old histories of RuneScape hacking, and scroll through forums like UnknownCheats, totally rapt. I was excited by the idea that I would one day be able to understand these exploits of these seemingly impenetrable games that I was so familiar with. It wasn’t about wanting to cheat or make money from hacks for me – it was about the joy of understanding a trick or exploit alone. It was my excitement about learning game hacking that led me to start learning C++ in my early teens, after seeing a now deleted video from one “douggem” on learning game hacking.\nDespite being a RuneScape player in my teens and having an interest in these hacks, I was never able to figure out how RuneScape bots were written. While there were many public resources written about different types of bots and how you might write a bot for an existing client, there were little to no resources for how you would start from scratch. This project aims to create a (private server) RuneScape bot using Java’s reflection API to implement an “inventory dropper” – a bot designed to automatically drop all items from the player’s inventory. This is not only to demonstrate the process of bot creation, but also to fill a gap in the public availability of educational resources on RuneScape botting: to help a younger version of myself get a little farther in his hacking goals.\nIntroduction\nThe goal of this project is to write a RuneScape bot using Java’s reflection API. Reflection allows Java to access the data and methods of Java classes at runtime, allowing us to programmatically interact with the running game client. This project seeks to extend an archived tutorial from the EctoTalk forum, which demonstrated the basics of writing a reflection/injection bot client, but stopped short of applying those techniques to write an actual bot. This tutorial will focus only on using reflection towards the end of implementing an “inventory dropper” bot – automating the process of dropping all items in the player’s inventory. While simple, this will allow us to demonstrate how reflection can be strategically used to implement a bot using fields and methods discovered by reverse engineering the client.\nPrior Work\nDuring my research for this project, the only resource I found that shows how you might begin to write a reflection bot from scratch was this thread, by a “Shenandoah”, on the now offline forum EctoTalk. While the post is about writing an injection bot, it also makes use of Java reflection to load the game’s client into our own process, giving us control over it. It is this code from this post that this project extends. Reading posts #1 and #2 up to the “Bytecode Basics” section can be considered required conceptual reading for this article.\nLike him, we’ll be using the open-source Runescape private server 2006scape as the target for our bot.\nJava Reflection\nThere are three main steps this bot must perform:\n\nLoading the game into a bot-controlled process\nReading the inventory array and inventory interface position information to find the location of items on the screen\nTriggering drop events on each of the found items in the inventory\n\nWe will implement these three steps using Java’s reflection API. The reflection API allows a program to access the fields and methods of loaded classes at runtime. I will now give you a high-level idea of how we can use reflection to implement of these steps:\n\nThe core Game class for Runescape extends Applet (or a subclass of Applet). We can load this class and then use reflection to instantiate it. This gives us a running instance of the game, within our bot process, that we can further interact with using reflection.\nAfter finding the inventory array by reverse engineering the client – which is the trickiest part of the project – we can use reflection to make the field public and get its value. This is basically the same for finding the inventory positions.\nDrop events can be triggered in Runescape by shift-clicking on the items of a player’s inventory. We can programmatically create our own keyboard and mouse events to simulate those, using reflection to submit them directly to the applet’s handlers.\n\nTechnical Breakdown\nThe code for this project can be found here.\nIn implementing the bot, I used four classes: Main, ReflectionUtils, ReflectionBot and BotKeyListener. As Main simply creates an instance of ReflectionBot, I will skip describing it further. Let’s break the remaining down class by class.\nReflectionUtils\nReflectionUtils provides three utility functions common to reflection operations that access fields or invoke methods. These functions save having to repeat the same code over and over again.\ngetField\n\nThe first method, getField, takes a loaded class and a string fieldName, and returns a Field. The Field represents a variable attached to a class that we are accessing through reflection. This Field can later be used to get or set the field on an instance of that class. By setting the field as accessible, we are bypassing Java’s access checking for the field. For us, this means we can access private fields.\nsetField\n\nThe second method, setField, takes a loaded class, a string FieldName, an Object that is an instance of the class, and a value to set the field to on the object. This is basically just a wrapper around getField, with an additional call to the field’s set method. Note: if you wanted to get a field’s value on an object, you could use the field’s get method, similarly to the way set is used here.\ninvokeMethod\n\nThe third method, invokeMethod, takes a loaded class, string methodName, a list of classes representing the parameter types, an object that is an instance of the class to invoke the method on, and a list of arguments corresponding to the parameters. Like with the fields, this method uses reflection to find the declared method with the given name and parameters and bypass access checks, but now also invokes it on the given object with the given arguments.\nReflectionBot\nThe job of this class is to load the game client, instantiate its main game class, and to load the game applet into its own window. This part is largely taken, with modifications, from the original EctoTalk post. As such, I will only cover it briefly in this section.\nAfter loading the client’s JAR file (JAR files being used to distribute Java executables) we create an instantiate the client’s game class:\n\nThen we can initialize our own JFrame, representing a window, and add this game applet to it. This will result in the game running within our own window.\n\nFinally for the game class, we initialize its fields and call its parent’s init function, just as are done in the client’s main function. (Since we are skipping the main class by creating the game object directly, we have to recreate its steps.)\n\nAt this point the applet has been created successfully, and the game will run like normal. The last step is to attach our own key listener to trigger on key events. This will be the entry point for our bot functionality.\n\nBotKeyListener\nBotKeyListener is the class that does the actual work of the bot. It will listen for key presses on the applet, and upon detecting the arbitrary start key, will use reflection to drop the items in the player’s inventory. Reflection is used to submit the bot’s virtual key and mouse events directly to the game applet’s key and mouse listeners. Simulating user input in this way is the simplest way I found to trigger actions with the game – there does not appear to be any single function that performs an item drop that we could call.\nAn input method leaves us with having to find out what entities to perform inputs on. In this case, I needed to find where the inventory field and inventory interface information was being stored in the client. From this, we would be able to determine the positions of each item in the player’s inventory and use key and mouse events to trigger a drop on it.\nFinding the Inventory Fields\nWhile it was tricky to determine exactly how to submit the mouse events to the game applet, most of the work of this bot was reverse engineering the client to find the inventory fields. I wanted to find two main things:\n\nThe inventory field: I was expecting to find an array or list that would represent the items in the player’s inventory. This would allow us to reflectively find which slots of the inventory had items in it, making the bot more efficient.\nThe inventory interface class/fields: This would be the implementation for the inventory’s GUI in the game. Finding this would allow us to reflectively find where on the screen we would need to click.\n\nStarting with a clone of the game’s repo, I grep’d for “inventory”:\n\nSeeing that class9_1 in Game has an “isInventoryInterface” field, I went into the class to find what class9_1 was:\n\nLooking now at the RSInterface class, we find that it has an inv[] array and a method swapInventoryItems:\n\nTo find out if these are the right fields, and how we can get the right RSInterface, we can set a breakpoint on the first line of this function, and then try swapping two items. After the breakpoint hits, we see:\n\nThe inv array is 28 items long, which is the maximum number of items in the player’s inventory. Further, the integers correspond to the items in my character’s inventory – the item ID 441 represents Iron Ore, and 0 represents an empty slot. We now know that if we can find the correct RSInterface, we can access the player’s current inventory reflectively.\nTo find the correct interface, we can move up the call stack to mainGameProcessor. The call to swapInventoryItems is on a class9:\n\nWhich is defined by:\n\n3214 is the index into the static field interfaceCache used to access the inventory’s RSInterface. Through the rest of my testing, I confirmed that this index is consistently used between runs and throughout the code. With this, we have found a way to access the inventory interface and the player’s inventory reflectively.\nSome GUI information is also attached to this class, including the width, height, invSpritePadX and invSpritePadY, but we still need to find out how to find the start coordinates of the inventory GUI reflectively. This can be found by breaking on the following lines of the buildInterfaceMenu:\n\nwhere i2 and j2 are the inventory interface’s x and y coordinates. As this is being calculated outside of the class using a parent interface, I opted to just hardcode these values for the bot.\nPerforming the Inventory Drop\nNow that we have found our method of input and our inventory interface fields, we can put the bot together.\nThe work of the bot is in the keyPressed function. The bot starts on a key pressed event for the forward slash key.\n\nThe first event we’ll send is a key down event for the shift key. When you click on an inventory item with the shift key pressed, the clicked item will be dropped.\n\nThen, we’ll use reflection to load the interfaceCache from the RSInterface class and then index that to get the inventory interface. We’ll use that to access all of the fields identified in the “Finding Inventory Fields” section.\n\nNow we’ll trigger click events to drop each item in the inventory. We’ll loop over the rows and columns using the height and width fields of the inventory interface. We’ll use the inventory array to check if there is an item in the current slot. Then we’ll calculate the click location, offset from the top-left corner of the slot. Finally, we’ll trigger the drop by directly calling the mouseMoved, mousePressed, and mouseReleased methods reflectively on the game’s RSApplet class. The reason why a mouseMoved event has to be sent is that the interface has to be loaded, which only occurs when the mouse moves over the inventory.\n\nFinally, we’ll release the shift key.\n\nDemonstration\n\nFurther Work\nThis “inventory dropper” was originally part of a larger mining bot that would mine a given ore until the character’s inventory was full, drop all of the items, and then start again. I decided to tighten the scope of this project to complete it in a more reasonable period of time. Extending this solution to perform mining would require being able to find the desired ore objects in the scene. The reverse engineering to find these ores has not been completed yet, and appears to be considerably more complex than just finding the inventory data due to the obfuscation, coupling, and complexity of the client. As such, it would be a worthwhile extension to this project, and would contribute greatly to public resources on creating bots from scratch.\n","id":"https://murdoch.website/reflection-bot/","title":"Creating a Runescape Reflection Bot from Scratch"},"https://murdoch.website/srry-stealer/":{"body":"Summary\n\n\nThis malware was categorized as “SrryStealer” found on MalwareBazaar\n\n\nThe malware originated from \"mythictherapy[.]org\", and the sample reached out to “linnisgood[.]site”, likely a C2.

The goal for this analysis will be to identify IOCs for this particular sample as well as to understand the infection chain associated with this SrryStealer sample.\nIOCs\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Type\n                Indicator\n                Description\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Domain\n                mythictherapy[.]org\n                The site apparently associated with the sample\n            \n            \n                SHA256\n                0147881f61d051b5918be81ce9fcab18e9b629be393b8065e50cc286d53f8927\n                The executable sample\n            \n            \n                SHA256\n                7649540d9d072df546b6b436b6a9784e58fde827ddc268465d800c2fae753724\n                Dropped MythicT24Setup.exe Electron Executable\n            \n            \n                SHA256\n                935c086fd04d537e5fe8ea9e3d99599f14b6957fa9f991009f76d1e2c17235d0\n                Dropped Uninstall MythicT24Setup.exe file\n            \n            \n                Domain\n                linnisgood[.]site\n                C2 server the application reaches out to\n            \n        \n    \n\nSample Analysis\nExecutable\n\nThe sample is a Portable executable file, 32 bit. Detect It Easy detects the sample as being created with Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS), which is a script-based system for creating Windows installers. From Didier Stevens' quick analysis of a NSIS-based malware, I discovered that we can open up this NSIS install file with 7zip, allowing us to extract the install files as well as the NSIS script. The results are shown in a flat view below:\n\nThe most interesting files appear to be:\n\napp-64.7z: could this hold the installed application?\n[NSIS].nsi: The NSIS install script\nUninstall MythicT24Setup.exe: This again appears to be a reference to the mythictherapy[.]org domain. Could the user think they are downloading a “mythic” application from this website?\n\napp-64.7z\nThis is just a 7zip file, that contains the files related to the installation of an executable called “MythicT24Setup.exe”:\n\nBased only on this 7zip output, this would appear to be an electron application.\nNSIS Install Script\nTaking a hint again from the Didier Stevens article, I jumped straight to the section marked Section_0:\n\nThere begins with apparent checks to see if MythicT24Setup.exe is running, under some conditions it will try to kill them.\nLater in the section, we find the part where the app 7zip is extracted.\n\nAt the end of the section, I found the following code snippet:\n\nExecShellAsUser is being called, following the pushing of a couple values. The first variable being pushed, `$_22_` is earlier set to MythicT24Setup.exe via ``StrCpy $_22_ $INSTDIR\\MythicT24Setup.exe``. This suggests to me that the last step of this install section is to execute that file.\nIn VirusTotal, we can see that these files are being written to AppData:\n\nVirusTotal also confirms that we can see that written MythicT24Setup exe being created as a new process:\n\nAnalyzing the Electron Application\nNow that we know that the installer is dropping the electron application and running it, we’d like to analyze the application. First we can use Detect It Easy to confirm that the application is electron-based:\n\nThen, I looked up techniques for analyzing Electron-based malware, and discovered this video by Malware Analysis for Hedgehogs. The code for electron applications, rather than being stored in the large executable, is actually stored in the “resources\\app.asar” file within the install directory.\n\nTo extract the data from this file, we can use an asar 7zip extension. After installing that tool, we can extract the file with 7zip:\n\npackage.json\nThe most notable thing here is the dependency on Primno’s DPAPI extension, which allows the application to unprotect data on Windows. This is expected functionality from a stealer, as protect data is commonly used to encrypt sensitive data stored by browsers.\n\napp.js\nThis is a fairly large obfuscated file, which is 1680 lines after running through de4js. Given the complexity of the file, I decided to start performing dynamic analysis at this point.\nThe first thing I noticed, running the sample, was that the CPU usage spiked dramatically. This seems to be because the code is using the strategy of creating a list with all of the codes and then indexing them, and then running a loop over which pushes them around until they are in the right order. The reason why I wasn’t seeing anything in Procmon is probably because this process just wasn’t completing.\nMoving over to Remnux, I tried dynamically analyzing the JS code on its own:\n\nThe first block is where the code gets stuck in the debugger, for hours, without completing. The condition for exiting the loop is when the computed sum _0x440544 equals 521221. The computed sum is based on a complicated expression drawing values from a list of strings which appear to be obfuscated. At the end of each loop iteration, if unsuccessful, the top element of this list is pushed to the back. Eventually, I would expect this to result in the correct ordering.\nHowever, notably, after untangling the sum and calculating the actual indices, I found the following:\n \nMany of the indices are far out of bounds of the list, which has 2121 elements. Since the modifications made to the list do not affect its size, we actually would never expect the sum to be anything but NaN. I am at this point not sure how to continue: unless I am missing something, I wouldn’t expect the rest of the code in the file to run.\nDynamic Analysis\nFirst, I launched the MythicT24Setup.exe electron application while FakeNetNG was running.\n\nThis revealed many DNS requests for the domain “linnisgood[.]site”, which has detections on VirusTotal:\n\nHowever, this domain no longer appears to be active:\n\nHowever, for the following filters on procmon, nothing suspicious is noticed:\n\nI don’t see any of the behaviour that I would expect to see from a stealer, like the reading of Chrome data files.\nStrings\nTo see if I could find suspicious strings, I used Process Hacker to get dumps for two of the MythicT24Setup processes.\n \nI found references to the C2 domain within the first set of strings, which confirms that it is this process that is reaching out.\n\nHowever, I don’t find any reference to files or file paths that we would expect from a stealer. If the C2 was still alive, the sample may have received those from it.\nFurther Dynamic Analysis\nGoing to try to use Powershell logging, as I see powershell being run in Procmon\n\nI’m also going to try to turn on HTTPS decryption in fakenet-ng, which is what the sample is trying to connect to the C2 server with.\n\nLooking in the results of the fakenet-ng logs, I don’t see any actual HTTP/HTTPS traffic.\nAnd after looking into the logs of particular connections (that I pulled from Procmon), I still don’t see anything interesting that is readable:\n\nAs for the Powershell logs, I don’t see anything interesting that is logged around the time that powershell was created in procmon.\n\n","id":"https://murdoch.website/srry-stealer/","title":"Srry Stealer Analysis"}},"docInfo":{"https://murdoch.website/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://murdoch.website/automating-flarevm/":{"body":425,"title":3},"https://murdoch.website/decompiling-godot-encrypted/":{"body":358,"title":5},"https://murdoch.website/fixing-xbox-hdmi/":{"body":452,"title":6},"https://murdoch.website/htb-methodology/":{"body":167,"title":2},"https://murdoch.website/kali-vm-on-m1/":{"body":237,"title":7},"https://murdoch.website/mounting-ntfs-freebsd/":{"body":122,"title":5},"https://murdoch.website/reflection-bot/":{"body":1156,"title":5},"https://murdoch.website/srry-stealer/":{"body":796,"title":3}},"length":9},"lang":"English"}
